# Team 8336A - Gladiator Robotics


> ## Programming Outline
> ### Jonathan's PID Project
> Contains a created libary that has the intent to simplify the implementation of PID throughout the rest of the project. Contains the created files:
>> ### /include/PIDController.h
>> Contains the actual PID controller implementation, with this filecontaining a class that can be created and called whereever in the rest of the program.
>> ### /src/main.cpp
>> Contains an example implementation of the PIDController.h, with the main function of the program being oriented on actually implementing the controller. More specifically, it creates and motors and groups them into motor groups and drivetrains, and craetes a PID controller for both the left side and the right side, with the implementation of moving a certain amount of inches, with the conversion (translation) into the units required for the wheel being calculated by the function DisToTheta.
