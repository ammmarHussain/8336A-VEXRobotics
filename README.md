> ## Programming Outline
> ### Jonathan's PID Project
> Contains a created libary that has the intent to simplify the implementation of PID throughout the rest of the project. Contains the created files:
>> ### /include/PIDController.h
>> Contains the actual PID controller implementation, with this file containing a class that can be created and called whereever in the rest of the program.
>> ### /src/main.cpp
>> Contains an example implementation of the PIDController.h, with the main function of the program being oriented on actually implementing the controller. More specifically, it creates motors and groups them into motor groups and drivetrains, and creates a PID controller for both the left side and the right side, with the implementation moving a certain amount of inches, these being calculated by the function DisToTheta.
